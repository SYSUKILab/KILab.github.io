      <description>&lt;p&gt;Large Language Models (LLMs) need to be both helpful and safe, but achieving both is a major challenge. We propose MidPO, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework that fine-tunes two specialized experts for safety and helpfulness and uses a dynamic routing mechanism to adaptively balance them, outperforming existing methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI-generated images are more visually stunning than ever, but how do they really stack up against natural, real-world photos? We introduce D-Judge, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically investigate and quantify the discrepancies that remain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
