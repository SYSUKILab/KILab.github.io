We introduce D-Judge, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically investigate and quantify the discrepancies that remain.\nDespite the rapid progress of generative models, AI-generated images (AIGIs) often fall short of real-world application standards. Existing evaluation methods provide an incomplete picture. They often focus on a narrow set of metrics like perceptual quality or text alignment, use small datasets, and primarily consider simple text-to-image prompts, neglecting more complex multimodal guidance.\nKey Problem: There\u0026rsquo;s no systematic, comprehensive way to measure the fine-grained differences between AI-generated and natural images, which is crucial for understanding model limitations and driving meaningful progress. üìÑ Paper üìÅ Code ü§ó Dataset What We Built #Our work introduces two core contributions to tackle this challenge:\nThe D-ANI Dataset: A massive new multimodal dataset featuring over 440,000 AI-generated images from 9 representative models (from GANs to DALL-E 3). It\u0026rsquo;s the first to include images generated from unimodal (Text-to-Image, Image-to-Image) and multimodal (Text-and-Image-to-Image) prompts. The D-Judge Framework: A fine-grained evaluation framework that assesses discrepancies across five crucial dimensions: naive visual quality, semantic alignment, aesthetic appeal, downstream task applicability, and coordinated human validation. Method \u0026amp; System #1. Framework Overview #D-Judge systematically compares AI-generated images with their natural counterparts. For a given prompt, we generate an AIGI and pair it with a real reference image. The framework then assesses the \u0026ldquo;Discrepancy Rate\u0026rdquo; (DR) between the two across our five dimensions, integrating both automated metrics and human judgment for a holistic view.\nFigure 1. The D-Judge framework evaluates discrepancies across five dimensions, complemented by human validation. 2. The D-ANI Dataset # Our Massive Dataset At the heart of our benchmark is the D-ANI (Distinguishing Natural and AI-generated) dataset. We started with 5,000 high-quality natural images from the MS COCO dataset, each with at least five captions. We then used these text-image pairs to prompt nine different generative models to create a diverse collection of over 440,000 AIGIs.\nModels: Includes GANs (GALIP, DF-GAN), various Stable Diffusion versions (v1.4, v1.5, v2.1, XL), Versatile Diffusion, and OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s DALL-E 2 \u0026amp; 3. Prompts: Uniquely covers Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text-and-Image-to-Image (TI2I) guidance. Figure 2. Our D-ANI dataset includes 440,000+ images from 9 models, guided by three types of prompts. 3. The 5-Dimension Evaluation # Our Evaluation Framework D-Judge assesses the gap between AI and reality from five perspectives:\nNaive Image Quality: How good is the image on a technical level? We measure this at three granularities: Structure-level: Low-level visual similarity using metrics like SSIM and LPIPS. Frame-level: Perceptual quality from a high-level view using metrics like BRISQUE and PIQE. Distribution-level: Holistic content differences across the entire dataset using FID and Inception Score. Semantic Alignment: Does the image match the prompt? We use CLIP Score to measure the consistency between the generated image and the guiding prompt(s). Aesthetic Appeal: Is the image visually pleasing? We use models like NIMA and LAION-AES to predict the artistic quality and attractiveness. Downstream Applicability: Can the image be used in other AI tasks? We test its utility in image recognition, object segmentation, and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Human Validation: How do people perceive these images? We collect human ratings on quality, alignment, and aesthetics to see if quantitative metrics align with human judgment. Representative Findings #Our extensive experiments reveal that while AIGIs are impressive, significant gaps remain.\nKey Discrepancies Revealed\nLarge Gaps Persist: AIGIs show substantial discrepancies from natural images, with difference rates of up to 40% in image quality, 33.57% in semantic alignment, and a staggering 96.95% in downstream task applicability (specifically VQA). Downstream Tasks Suffer: The poor performance in downstream tasks like fine-grained object recognition and VQA highlights that current models struggle with practical, real-world utility. Text Guidance is Key: Images generated with text prompts (T2I and TI2I) show much better semantic alignment than those generated from an image prompt alone (I2I). Human vs. Machine Evaluation üßê Key Finding: Human evaluators consistently identify larger discrepancies in quality, alignment, and aesthetics than our automated metrics do. This shows that current metrics don\u0026rsquo;t fully capture human perception and validates the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation. Category Matters: The gap between AI and natural images varies significantly across different content categories (e.g., \u0026ldquo;animal\u0026rdquo; vs. \u0026ldquo;accessory\u0026rdquo;), likely due to imbalances in training data. DALL-E 3, for instance, showed the most pronounced deviations, possibly due to its tendency to generate more stylized imagery.\nAcknowledgments # Acknowledgments: This work is supported by Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2023A1515012848), CCF-DiDi GAIA Collaborative Research Funds, A*STAR, CISCO Systems (USA) Pte.Ltd, and the National University of Singapore.

We propose MidPO, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework that fine-tunes two specialized experts for safety and helpfulness and uses a dynamic routing mechanism to adaptively balance them, outperforming existing methods.\nThe Safety vs. Helpfulness Dilemma #Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) is a delicate balancing act. Current methods often force a trade-off between being helpful and being safe.\nOnline alignment methods (like RLHF) can be overly cautious, leading them to refuse safe, harmless prompts. This is known as the \u0026ldquo;excessive safety\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;over-refusal\u0026rdquo; problem. Offline alignment methods (like DPO variants) often fail to adapt, sometimes providing helpful but harmful responses to unsafe prompts. Key Problem: Existing alignment techniques struggle to create LLMs that are both robustly safe against harmful queries and genuinely helpful for safe ones, often sacrificing one for the other. üìÑ Paper üìÅ Code (to be released) What We Built: The MidPO Framework #Our framework, MidPO (Mixture of Experts Dual Preference Optimization), addresses this challenge with two core components:\nTwo Specialized Experts: Instead of a one-size-fits-all model, we train two distinct experts: a Safety Expert and a Helpfulness Expert. We use our novel Single-Preference Enhanced DPO (SPE-DPO) method to make each expert highly proficient in its domain. A Dynamic Routing Mechanism: A smart \u0026ldquo;router\u0026rdquo; analyzes the user\u0026rsquo;s prompt and adaptively decides how much to listen to the Safety Expert versus the Helpfulness Expert. This allows the model to be cautious with unsafe prompts but open and helpful with safe ones. Efficient Offline Alignment: The entire framework is built on an offline alignment process, making it more stable and computationally efficient than online RLHF-based methods. Method \u0026amp; System # Framework Overview MidPO first transforms a base LLM into two specialized experts using LoRA fine-tuning with our SPE-DPO loss functions. Then, it freezes the experts and trains a dynamic router that learns to combine their contributions effectively for any given prompt, achieving a superior balance between safety and helpfulness. Figure 1. The MidPO framework, showing (a) the training of single-preference experts and (b) the dynamic routing mechanism. Single-Preference Enhanced Experts (SPE-DPO) The foundation of MidPO is creating highly specialized experts. Our proposed SPE-DPO method is designed for single-preference optimization. By introducing a homogeneous preference margin, it amplifies the distinction between good and bad responses within a single category (e.g., safe vs. unsafe), making the experts more effective than if they were trained with standard DPO.\nDynamic Routing Mechanism This is where the magic happens. The router analyzes the input prompt and assigns a weight to the Safety and Helpfulness experts. For an unsafe question (e.g., \u0026ldquo;How to do X illegal thing?\u0026rdquo;), it gives more weight to the Safety Expert. For a safe question (e.g., \u0026ldquo;How do I make my wife laugh?\u0026rdquo;), it prioritizes the Helpfulness Expert. This adaptive approach ensures the final response is context-appropriately safe and helpful.\nData \u0026amp; Settings # Base Model: We built MidPO on top of the widely used Alpaca-7B model.\nDatasets: We trained and evaluated MidPO on three popular benchmarks:\nPKU-Safe RLHF , Do Not Answer , and Wildguard Mix.\nWe compared MidPO against strong baselines, including\nSafe RLHF (an online method) and MODPO (an offline method), ensuring a fair comparison by using the same base model for all methods where possible.\nRepresentative Findings #Our comprehensive evaluation showed that MidPO sets a new standard for balancing safety and helpfulness.\nUnprecedented Balance MidPO consistently achieves the highest scores for both safety and helpfulness across all three datasets, significantly outperforming all baselines. Other methods either excel at one while failing at the other or are mediocre at both.\nFigure 2. MidPO (top right) achieves a superior balance of safety and helpfulness compared to baselines across three different datasets. Superior Experts and Routing # Better Experts: Our experts, fine-tuned with SPE-DPO, demonstrated superior single-preference performance compared to experts trained with vanilla DPO.\nEffective Routing: Ablation studies confirmed the crucial role of the dynamic routing mechanism. Removing it led to a significant drop in both safety (19.25% win rate) and helpfulness (13.62% win rate).\nKey Finding: The combination of highly specialized experts and an adaptive routing mechanism allows MidPO to navigate the safety-helpfulness trade-off more effectively than any previous method.
