## Abstract

In Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural ones remains a key challenge. Despite advancements in generative models, significant discrepancies persist. To systematically investigate and quantify these discrepancies, we introduce an AI-Natural Image Discrepancy accessing benchmark (D-Judge) aimed at addressing the critical question: \textit{how far are AI-generated images (AIGIs) from truly realistic images?} We construct D-ANI, a dataset with 5,000 natural images and over 440,000 AIGIs generated by nine models using Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text and Image-to-Image (TI2I) prompts. Our framework evaluates the discrepancy across five dimensions: naive image quality, semantic alignment, aesthetic appeal, downstream applicability, and human validation. Results reveal notable gaps, emphasizing the importance of aligning metrics with human judgment.
